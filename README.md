# SRGANs_For_Medical_Images

This project implements a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) designed to enhance the resolution of medical images. Built using PyTorch and deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface, the system allows users to upload any image—especially those under 512x512 resolution—which is then preprocessed and passed through a trained generator model to produce a high-resolution (512x512) output. The generator was trained on paired low- and high-resolution images resized to 128x128 and 512x512 respectively, enabling it to learn detailed upscaling patterns. The application includes smart resizing and normalization techniques, making it robust for a wide range of image inputs, and supports CPU and GPU execution. Ideal for healthcare researchers and developers, this tool offers an accessible way to explore super-resolution in medical imaging.
